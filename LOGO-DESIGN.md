## Design Philosophy

### Built by Agents, for Agents
Our logo reflects that we're not just a technology company - we're insurance professionals who build technology. The combination of traditional insurance branding (navy/gold, serif fonts, professional aesthetic) with modern tech elements (servers, animations, digital infrastructure) perfectly captures our unique position in the market.

### Visual Continuity
By maintaining consistent branding with Metro Point Insurance, we signal to clients that:
1. We share the same values and expertise
2. We understand insurance operations deeply
3. Our technology is built on 30+ years of real-world experience
4. We're a trusted extension of the Metro Point family

### Modern Yet Timeless
The animated server lights add contemporary flair while the classic color scheme and serif typography ensure the logo won't feel dated in years to come.
