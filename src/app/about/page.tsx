            <p className="text-primary mb-6">
              Metro Point Technology was born from a unique combination: decades of insurance experience
              and a lifelong immersion in technology.
            </p>

            <p className="text-primary mb-6">
              I'm Patrick Stabell. I owned and operated my own independent insurance agency in Orange County, California
              for many years, building relationships with clients and carriers while learning every aspect of the business.
              But technology has been in my DNA since birth—my father spent his entire career as a physicist at IBM,
              and that analytical, problem-solving mindset was molded into me from day one.
            </p>

            <p className="text-primary mb-6">
              After 30 years in the insurance industry, I got tired of using software that was either too complicated,
              too expensive, or just didn't solve the right problems. So I combined my insurance expertise with
              the technical foundation I inherited and started building tools that actually work for agents in the field.
            </p>

            <p className="text-primary mb-6">
              Every feature in our products solves a real problem I've encountered while running an agency.
              If it doesn't work for us, we don't ship it. That's the Metro Point Technology difference.

              <p className="text-primary">
                We're agents who learned to code, not developers who learned about insurance.
                This fundamental difference shapes everything we build.

              <p className="text-primary">
                These apps solve real agency problems. We don't build features speculatively.
                If we don't need it, we don't build it.

                Product roadmaps come from social media feedback and agent conversations.
